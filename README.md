# odin-admin-dashboard

The goal of this little project is to recreate an admin dashboard designed TheOdinProject provided.\
Now when I've learned about Grid I must be able to use it along with Flexbox to easily make layouts.\
Although the task is to use Grid wherever possible, I will try to use both interchangeably where either of them seems more appropriate.\
It must be responsive, but for desktop devices only. I don't have to build a design for mobile especially while I don't know some principles like media queries etc.\
